"""What gets registered into ``/Custom``, and the rules a name has to satisfy.

This is the single source of truth for the page set. ``register_pages.py``
writes what is listed here; ``tests/test_manifest.py`` asserts every rule below
holds, because each one is a way mhttpd will silently serve the wrong thing (or
nothing) rather than report an error.

Why registration works the way it does
--------------------------------------
``add_custom_path()`` (midas ``progs/mhttpd.cxx:3602``) returns a value that
starts with ``/`` unchanged -- ``/Custom/Path`` is only prepended to *relative*
names. And a plain static request such as ``GET /dqm-common.js``
(``mhttpd.cxx:13146``) is resolved by looking for the ODB key
``/Custom/dqm-common.js``, then ``...&``, then ``...!``, and serving whatever
file that key names.

So every page and every asset is registered as its own ``/Custom/<name>`` key
holding an **absolute** path, and ``/Custom/Path`` is never read or written.
That is what lets these pages coexist as a guest in somebody else's experiment:
musip's ``quads_config_fe.cpp:668`` rewrites ``/Custom/Path`` on every start,
and it does not matter to us at all.
