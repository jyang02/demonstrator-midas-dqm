# midas-dqm

Data-quality monitoring for MIDAS experiments, built as **mhttpd custom pages**
plus (later) one analyzer client. No nginx, no node, no ROOT, no ZMQ, no second
web stack: the pages are plain HTML and JavaScript served by the mhttpd the
experiment already runs, on the port operators already have open.

Two halves, kept apart on purpose:

| generic — works at any MIDAS experiment | experiment-specific |
|---|---|
| `src/mdqm/dqm/`, `src/mdqm/install/` | `src/mdqm/plugins/` |
| `pages/js/dqm-common.js` | `pages/js/dqm-scalars.js` and friends |

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
mdqm-register-pages --experiment MYEXPT      # writes the /Custom keys
```

Then open the experiment's mhttpd and pick **Scalers** from the side menu.

`--list` shows what would be registered, `--dry-run` says what would change,
`--check` verifies every registered key still resolves to a readable file, and
`--remove` unregisters (only the keys pointing into this checkout).

Registration is idempotent and safe to run on every start — that is how a moved
checkout heals itself.

## Sharing an experiment

The pages register as `/Custom/<name>` keys holding **absolute** paths, and never
read or write `/Custom/Path`. That is what makes them safe as a guest: another
group's frontend may rewrite `/Custom/Path` on every start (musip's does) without
affecting us at all.

Use `--prefix` to namespace the menu entries if a name might collide:

```bash
mdqm-register-pages --experiment Mu3e --prefix WD
```

The prefix must be space-free, for the same reason the keys are: the key becomes
both `?cmd=custom&page=<key>` and the argument to `mhttpd_init()`.

Registration **refuses** to overwrite a key whose value points outside this
checkout, and says what it found. It never writes `/Custom` as a subtree.

## Configuration

The scaler page discovers boards, banks, labels and history events from the ODB
at load; nothing is compiled in. Optional overrides live in `/DQM/Scalars`,
seeded by the installer. With that subtree absent the page uses identical
built-in defaults and says so, so it works on an experiment nobody has set up.

The one key worth knowing about is `Bank Pattern` — capture 1 is the role
letter, capture 2 the board id. Pointing the page at a different experiment's
naming scheme is a config change, not a code change.

## Development

```bash
python -m pytest                                    # no MIDAS needed
MDQM_NODE=/path/to/node python -m pytest            # + the JavaScript tests
```

The JS tests run the real page code against fixtures captured verbatim from a
live ODB, using a small DOM stub in `tests/js/domstub.js` rather than a browser.
Node is **not** a dependency — the pages have no build step — so those tests skip
where it is missing.

`tests/js/domstub.js` models mhttpd's refresh loop rather than approximating it,
because its contract is where this page is easiest to get wrong. Two rules are
worth knowing before touching a handler:

- **A `modb` watcher's first value fires `onload`, not `onchange`.** mhttpd
  stores it silently and fires `onchange` only on *subsequent* changes. A
  handler wired to `onchange` alone never runs while the ODB is static — which
  is exactly the case when the frontend it is monitoring has died.
- **A `modbvalue`'s `innerHTML` is rewritten every tick**, but `onchange` fires
  only on change. Anything that renders text from a handler is correct for one
  tick and then silently reverts.

Both of those shipped as bugs during development and are now regression tests.

### Seeing the page without a browser

```bash
scripts/shoot.py "http://localhost:8088/?cmd=custom&page=Scalers" out.png \
    --wait-for "document.querySelector('#dqm-root h2')" --console
```

`firefox --screenshot` is not usable here: it fires on the load event, which for
any MIDAS page is long before the content exists — the stock status page
photographs as the word "Loading...". `shoot.py` drives geckodriver over plain
WebDriver HTTP (no selenium dependency), waits for a condition you name, and can
dump the console and any uncaught exceptions. It exits non-zero if the condition
never becomes true, so it works as a test and not only as a camera.

### The one thing that will waste your afternoon

mhttpd stamps `Expires: <now + 24 h>` on anything served through `send_fp()`,
with no `ETag` and no `Last-Modified`. Pages are exempt because their `/Custom`
key contains no dot, which routes them through `show_custom_page()` instead —
but **assets are not**. Bump the `?v=` on the `<script src>` and `<link href>`
when you change a `.js` or `.css` file, or hard-reload (Ctrl-Shift-R).

## Troubleshooting

**`show_custom_page: Cannot open file ... errno 13`** — mhttpd's uid cannot read
the file. `mdqm-register-pages --check` tests readability from *its own* uid,
which is necessary and not sufficient; check the whole path is traversable by
whoever runs mhttpd.

**The side menu shows a page that 404s** — the checkout moved. Re-run
`mdqm-register-pages`; it rewrites values that are recognisably stale copies of
its own.

**`/Custom/Path` appeared as an empty string** — mhttpd creates it itself on the
first unmatched URL once `/Custom` exists. Expected; leave it alone.
